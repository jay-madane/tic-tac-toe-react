# Tic Tac Toe App

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React. The game allows two players to take turns and place their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: Play against another person locally.
- **Win detection**: The game automatically detects when a player has won or if the game is a draw.
- **Simple UI**: Clean and minimalistic user interface.
